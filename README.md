Python Interface to Cloud Sites (PseudoAPI)
=================
This attempts to provide a programatic interface to Rackspace Cloud Sites by parsing information and interactive with the control panel interface in lieu of an API.

*Very initial stages, not fit for human consumption yet.*

Requires "mechanize" (`easy_install mechanize`), re and json (so far).
